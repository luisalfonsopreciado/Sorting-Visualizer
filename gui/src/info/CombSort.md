# Comb Sort

<br/>

<p>
Comb Sort is mainly an improvement over Bubble Sort. 
Comb Sort improves on Bubble Sort by using gap of size more than 1. The gap starts with a large value and shrinks by a factor of 1.3 in every iteration until it reaches the value 1. Thus Comb Sort removes more than one inversion counts with one swap and performs better than Bubble Sort. 
</p>

Although, it works better than Bubble Sort on average, worst case remains O(n2).

Time Complexity : Worst case complexity of this algorithm is O(n2) and the Best Case complexity is O(n).

Auxiliary Space : O(1).
