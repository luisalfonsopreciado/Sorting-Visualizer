# Heap Sort

Heap sort is a comparison based sorting technique based on Binary Heap data structure. It is similar to selection sort where we first find the maximum element and place the maximum element at the end. We repeat the same process for remaining element.

# Pseudo Code

```
Input data: 4, 10, 3, 5, 1
         4(0)
        /   \
     10(1)   3(2)
    /   \
 5(3)    1(4)

The numbers in bracket represent the indices in the array 
representation of data.

Applying heapify procedure to index 1:
         4(0)
        /   \
    10(1)    3(2)
    /   \
5(3)    1(4)

Applying heapify procedure to index 0:
        10(0)
        /  \
     5(1)  3(2)
    /   \
 4(3)    1(4)
The heapify procedure calls itself recursively to build heap
 in top down manner.
```
