# Sorting Visualizer

Welcome to Sorting Visualizer! I built this application because I was interested in sorting algorithms, and I wanted to see them in action. I hope you enjoy using this application as much as I had fun building it. You can access it here: <a href="https://luisalfonsopreciado.github.io/Sorting-Visualizer">Complete Project</a>

**Quick Sort** 

**Merge Sort**
